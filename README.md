# FoundryBWCompendium

This repository contains materials for use with [Foundry Virtual Tabletop](https://foundryvtt.com/). Please ensure that you know what you're doing when you're editing files on your server. I only half know what I'm doing half the time, so make sure to double-check everything.

## Introduction

This is a set of Compendiums for Foundry Virtual Tabletop that are compatible with [StasTserk Burning Wheel Module](https://github.com/StasTserk/foundry-burningwheel), for the [Burning Wheel](https://www.burningwheel.com/burning-wheel/) tabletop RPG. I am not associated with either StasTserk or the BWHQ, and this is an independent work based off some files shared in the [Burning Wheel Discord](https://discord.gg/kdcjAgS).

## Installation

**N.B. Always back up your files before making changes!**

Installation is now available directly through Foundry VTT via the Manifest URL (explained in [Foundry Wiki](https://foundryvtt.wiki/en/basics/Modules)). The Manifest URL you should use is: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PauloDeTiege/FoundryBWCompendium/master/module.json

Please note that as of V11, you'll have to go to config settings on the right-hand panel, select "Manage modules", and then check "Foundry BW Compendium" and save. It'll reload the game world, and then everything should be available.

## Current Status

- Some elements from the BWG book are not included, such as Spell Songs and Sorcery Spells;
- Many elements from the Codex are not included, including all Monster Lifepaths, Traits, and Skills.

See the Issues tab for a more detailed list of exactly what still needs to be done.

## Acknowledgements
Thanks go to Agolp for working out how to install modules via Manifest URL.
